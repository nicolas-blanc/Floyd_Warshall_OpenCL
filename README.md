# Floyd_Warshall_OpenCL
Parallel Implementation of Floyd Warshall Algorithm using OpenCL

This repository contains the parallel implementation of Floyd Warshall Algorithm using OpenCL language.

Implementation is done in Visual Studio Express Edition 2012.

To run the code load the .sln file in Visual Studio and press ctrl+f5

Two seperate output file will be created containing the output and the execution time of both parallel and sequential algorithm.
